# Analyzing-Chemical-formulations-in-Cosmetic-products

The cosmetics analysis project provides critical insights into the presence and management of Titanium dioxide (TiO2) in the cosmetics industry under the California Safe Cosmetics Act. I found that 86.84% of products contain TiO2, which, despite its potential carcinogenic classification, appears to pose minimal health risks through skin exposure.

Companies responded to TiO2 regulations with varying strategies. LOreal USA maintained the status quo, while Revlon, Coty, and Bare Essentials predominantly chose discontinuation. S+ balanced both discontinuation and reformulation. Revlon, uniquely, applied reformulation and discontinuation to one product.

This project highlights the complexity of cosmetics regulation and its impact on product formulation. It emphasizes the need for transparency and consumer awareness. These findings inform consumer choices and contribute to a safer cosmetics industry.
